    CatalystX::Controller::Sugar::ActionPack - Cx::C::Sugar plugins

VERSION
    0.04

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution is a collection of CatalystX::Controller::Sugar
    plugins.

  CatalystX::Controller::Sugar::ActionPack::Default
    This module acts as a default handler for a controller. It will either
    server a file by its best knowledge or do "go('/error', ["not_found"])".

  CatalystX::Controller::Sugar::ActionPack::End
    This plugin should be injected into the Root controller, or a controller
    with namespace set to "" (empty string). It provides something similar
    to Catalyst::Action::RenderView.

  CatalystX::Controller::Sugar::ActionPack::Error
    Used to server custom error pages, which the webapp dispatch to.

  CatalystX::Controller::Sugar::ActionPack::Merge
    Provides an action which can serve multiple files in one request. The
    reason for this is easier maintenance of css and js files, while having
    less request to the web server.
